And we’re only getting started.Our mission is to build the world’s leading platform for hourly workers and enterprises enabling flexibility, choice, and upward social mobility.Join a rocketship. This is a unique opportunity to join the ground floor of a rapidly scaling business that is changing the way hourly labor works and capturing a $2 trillion dollar opportunity in the US alone. Ownership + impact. Join a team that is challenging and supporting one another to build a great business and create flexibility, choice, and upward social mobility for workers everywhere. Captain your career path. Enjoy accelerated learning and growth working with a world-class team from top tech companies (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Google, Amazon), business schools (e.g. HBS, GSB, Wharton), and professional services (e.g. Bain, BCG, Goldman). Become a world-class executor. We believe that #ExecutionIsBinary, and are dedicated to helping you master that skill for life here and beyond. Mission: What we do and why we need you The mission of the Data Science team is to build the models that increase shift fill rate and fulfillment quality by maximizing outcomes and opportunities for high reliability partners and nurturing lower-reliability partners. We work cross functionally with engineering to inform, design, and build dispatch algorithms that drive our business forward, at scale.In this role, you might build and iterate on reliability forecasting models and dispatch algorithms, analyze how features correlate with and influence shift fill rates, and test how incentives influence the behavior of workers on our platform. Whatever it is, you will work on what will move the needle most for Shiftsmart.Shiftsmart is based in New York City but we are open to remote applicants for this role.Outcomes: What problems you will solveYou will partner closely with our machine learning, data engineering, product, and operations teams to:Build and iterate on capacity, utilization, and cannibalization models for high reliability partners to maximize fill rates at a high degree of accuracy, using features such as time of day, day of week, etc. Develop partner lead scoring metrics to maximize LTV and the ROI on growth that forecasts reliability at a greater accuracy at an earlier stage in the partner lifecycle, and understand how incentives influence reliability (e.g., wages, bonus). Inform the algorithms behind shift dispatch models to drive greater shift fill rates and shift quality.

Pragmatic approach: Able to prioritize problems for what drives business impact.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.Operating Principles @ ShiftsmartInspired by Leadership Principles @ AmazonExecution Is BinaryWe #GetShiftDone. We take immense pride in both the quality of our work and our relentless determination to deliver on our commitments. If we say we are going to do something, we do it.We own the outcome with an unstoppable mindset through the finish line and are impatient to move the ball forward. This means we work really hard, execute with urgency, and ruthlessly challenge timelines for anything important. As a result, we do not defer responsibility to other teams or individuals. Instead, we take the problem as far as we can and only when needed ask others for help.Each time a crisis or opportunity emerges we take the hill as one team, because we are allergic to the words “it can’t be done”.Missionaries, Not MercenariesWe before me. We believe in our mission to build a better world for workers. We understand why our work matters and take seriously how it impacts our customers and our partners. This belief permeates everything we do from the strategic to the mundane.We are energetic, ambitious, and want to win. We constantly raise the standards for ourselves and everyone around us. We show up for our customers, our partners, and most importantly our teammates, and make every effort to build lasting relationships with each of them.We do not measure success based on our titles or the size of our empires. This also means we put the needs of the business before the details of our job descriptions. Rather than fight for a bigger piece of the pie, we fight to grow the entire thing and recognize this is how to grow our careers too.Inputs > OutcomesWe work really hard. Fundamentally changing how labor works is not easy. It often requires long days, late nights, and weekends to deliver on our commitments. We lean into this challenge.We focus on the process. We think in terms of value chains and appreciate that a bad process with a good outcome is simply dumb luck.We lead with data. We use facts, not fiction, to build narratives and make decisions. To do this we prepare written memos in advance and resist the urge to engage in endless water cooler what ifs, because we value the time and attention of our teammates.We hire and develop the best. When we decide to hire a new team member, we do so because we believe they will increase the talent density on our team. We view ourselves as leverage maximizers rather than inconvenience reducers and strive to increase the output of everyone we interact with.Honesty Over HarmonyWe share the truth even when it is painful. We do not, however, share the truth callously to hurt people’s feelings or make them look bad. We also assume positive intent. If someone is not delivering in a way that we need, we ask them and tell them before assuming the worst.We embrace mutual feedback. As people leaders we care more about our team’s growth and success than how much others like us. As individuals we seek, accept, and apply feedback. We do not give or take feedback personally because we understand it enables us to learn and grow.We tell the truth to ourselves. We reject a pollyannaish view of our world. Instead if something isn’t going well that we are responsible for, we call it out. And when someone calls out their own truth that may be less optimal, we don’t punish them for it.We have the meeting in the meeting. If something is broken or we disagree, we call it out and say something in the moment even if it feels uncomfortable to do so. This means that if something is broken, we do not just accept it and complain later.Invent & IterateWe are inventors @ heart. We categorically reject the phrase “that is how it’s always been done”, and constantly discover new and better ways to do more with less. This means we are resourceful and often do things that don’t scale, only to create ways to scale them later. We’re builders.We think BIG. At every level of the company, we embrace big, hairy, audacious, and transformative goals. We fear lack of progress and incremental thinking more than failing to deliver or falling short of an audacious goal. We believe courage means to try without fear and learn without ego.We do not let perfect get in the way of better. When faced with the choice we prioritize delivering something, even if imperfect, over endless debate and alignment. We embrace good mistakes.Compensation Range: $150K - $225K",Entry level,Full-time,Engineering and Information Technology,"Technology, Information and Internet"

Our cross-functional teams leverage AI, cutting-edge tech, and tons of data to help commercial insurance underwriters Bind with Confidence.Why We're Here:For hundreds of years. businesses have tried to find the right policy to protect themselves and their employees. However, commercial insurance is plagued with a big problem: it's really complicated!Insurers find it hard to understand the true exposures of businesses and to profitably provide them with policies that reflect that risk. Businesses - like contractors, hotels, restaurants, transportation fleets, real estate lessors, and others - struggle to find the coverage they need and are often left underinsured, uninsured, or paying too much for what they need.That's where we come in. Our AI-powered underwriting workbench - Copilot - compiles everything underwriters need, and flags the exposures they need to know about. With Copilot, underwriters can find critical information in a flash; digitize their underwriting guidelines; triage, prioritize, and track their book; and automatically read and summarize key documents, like loss runs and supplemental applications – all out of the box. This means that insurance carriers grow faster and are more profitable, and businesses get the right coverage at the right rates. It's the way insurance should work.Salary range: $100k – $150k Equity range: 0.005% – 0.025%What we are looking for:Kalepa is looking for Machine Learning Engineers with 3+ years of experience to frame, develop and deploy at-scale of machine learning models to understand the risk of various classes of businesses. We are a fully remote startup building software to transform and disrupt commercial insurance. Our HQ is located in New York.In this role, you will be turning vast amounts of structured and unstructured data from many sources (web data, geolocation, satellite imaging, etc.) into novel insights about behavior and risk. You will work closely with a small team designing, building, and deploying machine learning models to tackle our customers' questions. You will collaborate with a small team of full-stack, data, and DevOps engineers.Every business on the planet needs insurance. Nearly one trillion ($1T) dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance to protect businesses from fires, injuries, lawsuits, etc. However, commercial insurance is plagued with a big problem. Businesses and insurers don't trust each other. This leads to a lot of economic waste. Missed opportunities, mispricing, and mistakes. Everyone is worse off.By combining cutting-edge data science and a proprietary learning engine in a delightful-to-use software platform, Kalepa is solving this problem and turning every underwriter into a top underwriter. There are many challenging technical problems as we continue to build and expand our software -- and a massive opportunity to transform an ancient industry that comprises 6% of world GDP.Kalepa's team members bring experiences from Facebook, Google, Amazon, ClassPass, Atlassian, Mastercard, MIT, Berkeley, UPenn, the University of Warsaw, and the Israel Defense Forces.Kalepa is backed by IA Ventures, lead early-stage investors on TheTradeDesk (IPO, $38B valuation), Datadog (IPO, $32B), TransferWise (last valued at $5B), DataRobot ($2.7B), Flatiron Health (acquired for $2B), and several other unicorns and public companies.About you:You love to hustle: finding ways to get things done, destroying obstacles, and never taking no for an answer.
